# Ansible Server Configuration Project

This project demonstrates the basics of configuration management using Ansible. It includes a playbook (setup.yml) and associated roles to configure a Linux server hosted on AWS. The configuration includes setting up basic utilities, a web server (nginx), deploying a static website, and configuring SSH access.
